Introduction

Virtual Network Function (VNF) chain is a chain of different network functions (NF). Each network function is an application level service such as Firewall, Intrusion Detection System, Encoder, etc, .... Data packets may flow through these services in an established order. A specific order of these network functions/services is called a service chain. Virtualization technique allows the service chain to be deployed into the cloud in a flexible way that can satisfy different objectives such as minimizing deployment cost, or maximizing the service performance.
